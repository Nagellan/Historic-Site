# Historic-Site
Site is made as a course project in IT at humanitarian institute.

The purpose of this site is to show as much technologies as possible. For this reason, site is not designed well (the design is strict and restrained because of historic themes) and is overloaded with different animations.

The site is available [here](https://nagellan.github.io/Historic-Site/)
